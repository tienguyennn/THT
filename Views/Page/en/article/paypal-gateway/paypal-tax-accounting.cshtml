Some tips you can implement right away are.</p><ol> <li>It is crucial to <strong>save and archive statements for all PayPal transactions </strong>and retailer account reports. If needed, you can print the physical copies to maintain record-keeping.</li> <li>When transferring funds from a PayPal account to a regular bank account, it is advisable <strong>not to leave incoming payments on the PayPal account for an extended period</strong>. This can help ease the suspicion of PayPal investigators.</li> <li>You can consider <strong>creating 2 PayPal accounts: one to receive money, and one to act as a clearing account</strong> connecting to your business bank account. For seamless tracking, payments from the PayPal account to the bank account and vice versa should be consistently posted through the clearing account.</li> <li>Due to the commission charged by PayPal, the amount deposited into the PayPal account is not the original gross price. Your accounting team should <strong>record the full price (gross invoice amount) as revenue </strong>and<strong> separately post the PayPal commission as "Incidental costs of monetary transactions" categorized under operating expenses.</strong></li> </ol><h2 class="indexed"><span id="what-paypal-compatible-accounting-solutions-can-you-use-to-ease-the-accounting-burden" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">4.</span> <span class="heading_text">What Paypal-compatible accounting solutions can you use to ease the accounting burden?</span></h2><p>As you can see, there are many things you must keep in mind when dealing with accounting for PayPal accounts.
