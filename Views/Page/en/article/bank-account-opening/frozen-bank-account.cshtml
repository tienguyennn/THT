It is the automatic safeguard protocol of the banks against money laundering, terrorism financing, or fraud.</p><p>That is why even legitimate businesses can get flagged if their transactions look unusual.</p><p>Here are 5 common high-risk, suspicious activities you may do to activate account freezing:</p><ol> <li>Large or sudden deposits/withdrawals (especially cross-border).</li> <li>Transfers to or from high-risk countries.(North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.)</li> <li>A sudden spike in transaction volume or frequency. (You typically earn 3,000 USD per month, but you earn 300,000 USD this April)</li> <li>Frequent cash deposits (3 to 4 times higher than your normal transactions)</li> <li>Buying high-risk assets (gold, diamond, land)</li> <li>Transactions that donâ€™t match your businessâ€™s normal profile. (Buying toxic chemicals, but your company specializes in fish product exportation)</li> </ol><p>In summary, if your account/business account performs differently from your normal day-to-day activities, it is more likely to be locked. Because your accounts show signs of being in an anti-money laundering scheme.</p><h4>How to resolve high-risk freezes</h4><p>Banks are legally obligated to report red flags. In the US, they file reports with FinCEN. In the UK, itâ€™s the NCA. In Hong Kong, the JFIU.Â </p><p>Thatâ€™s why suspicious activity freezes are some of the hardest to resolve.Â </p><p>In this situation, the account holder must prove the source and purpose of the funds with legitimate financial transactions and documents to prove the money is for legitimate business activities.Â </p><p>You must go directly to the bank to speak with the banker and bring the relevant documents to resolve this issue. You can not do it via Gmail, telephone calls.Â </p><p>To avoid the high-risk freezes, you should:</p><ul> <li>Monitor your transactions monthly so you spot unusual patterns before the bank does.</li> <li>Flag high-risk behaviors (like big cross-border transfers) and prepare documentation.</li> <li>Notify your bank in advance of large purchases, travel, or transactions outside your normal activity (You can notify your account manager).</li> </ul><h3 class="indexed"><span id="unusual-transaction-freezes" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">4.2.</span> <span class="heading_text">Unusual transaction freezes</span></h3><h4>Examples of unusual transaction freezes</h4><p>While similar to suspicious activity, this freeze is more about protecting you from fraud than assuming youâ€™re doing something illegal.</p><p>Many freezes of this type are triggered by stolen cards or compromised account credentials. A freeze gives you and the bank time to verify if the activity was truly authorized.</p><p>That is why unusual transaction freezes are precautionary freezes to stop hackers from illegally stealing your money.</p><p>Examples of unusual transactions include:</p><ol> <li>Large purchases in distant locations you donâ€™t usually shop or travel.</li> <li>Multiple failed or repeated attempts at odd transactions.</li> <li>Several small, rapid-fire payments.</li> <li>Strange recurring subscriptions you didnâ€™t set up.</li> <li>Sudden high-value transfers to unfamiliar accounts.</li> <li>Foreign currency spending when youâ€™re not abroad.</li> <li>How to resolve an unusual transaction freeze</li> </ol><h4>How to resolve an unusual transaction freeze</h4><p>If you find yourself in an unusual transaction freeze, you should do the 2 following four steps to protect your accounts.</p><ul> <li>If you use a PayPal account connected to your bank account, you must update travel schedules in your PayPal account to help avoid problems with locked accounts.</li> <li>Use two-factor authentication and monitor alerts so you can confirm (or deny) suspicious charges instantly with your banker via phone calls or your banking apps.</li> </ul><h3 class="indexed"><span id="debt-related-freezes" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">4.3.</span> <span class="heading_text">Debt-related freezes</span></h3><h4>Examples of debt-related freezes</h4><p>Another common reason for a frozen account is unpaid debts.Â  Creditors (like credit card companies, lenders, or even the government) canâ€™t freeze your account directly. But with a court judgment, they can order your bank to do it.Â Once that happens, money can be taken from your account to cover:</p><ul> <li>The debt you owe</li> <li>Court-approved fees</li> </ul><p>Examples of debts that can trigger a freeze include:</p><ul> <li>Unpaid taxes to the tax authorities (IRAS, IRS, IRD)</li> <li>Student loans</li> <li>Car loans or personal loans</li> <li>Mortgages</li> <li>Divorce settlements</li> </ul><p>In these cases, both the creditor and your bank will notify you. Youâ€™ll usually get a court order first, then a notice from your bank once the freeze is in place.</p><div class="glac-article-box-cta"><div class="row"><div class="col d-flex flex-column justify-content-center"><p class="glac-article-heading-box-cta">Other scenarios for debt-related freezes</p><div class="glac-article-text-box-cta"><p>If you are a foreign worker working in another country with a working visa (Employment Pass in Singapore), you must do <a href="../tax-accounting/tax-accounting-in-singapore/tax-clearance.html">tax clearance (Pay all the taxes to IRAS)</a> before leaving the country.

(fall below standard account balance for more than 6 months,)</li> </ul><h4>How to resolve non-compliance freeezes</h4><p>These freezes are the easiest to resolve since the account holders just need to follow the requirements to lift the freeze.</p><ul> <li>Keep your personal and business details updated (address, company ownership changes)</li> <li>Submit the requested documents on time</li> <li>Review your account agreement so youâ€™re clear on whatâ€™s required.</li> </ul><h3 class="indexed"><span id="dormancy-freezes" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">4.5.</span> <span class="heading_text">Dormancy freezes</span></h3><h4>Examples of dormancy freezes</h4><p>If your account sits unused for too long, it can raise red flags and trigger dormancy freezes.Â Because dormant accounts pose these 2 problems</p><ol> <li>Dormant accounts are prime targets for fraudsters since theyâ€™re less likely to be monitored, and they use dormant accounts to split large sums of money into smaller chunks to make them harder to trace)</li> <li>Inactive accounts create maintenance costs for banks.</li> </ol><p>To reduce both risks, banks may freeze inactive accounts, and if inactivity continues, they may even close them.</p><p>For example, in the U.S., most states require banks to hand over dormant funds to the stateâ€™s unclaimed property office after 3â€“5 years of no activity. This process is called escheatment. Banks usually send notices before this happens.</p><h4>How to resolve dormancy freezes</h4><p>Based on our experience helping clients open accounts overseas in Singapore, Hong Kong, and the U.S, here are 3 simple actions you can take:</p><ul> <li>Make small transactions regularly (deposit, transfer, or bill payment) every 2 weeks if there are no business activities</li> <li>Keep your contact details updated to avoid missing any inactivity alerts from the bank.</li> <li>Close or consolidate unused accounts instead of letting them sit idle and risk being frozen.

If your account is linked directly or indirectly to an investigation, it may be frozen until the matter is resolved.</p><p>This can happen in cases like:</p><ul> <li>Ongoing tax audits or disputes.</li> <li>Investigations into money laundering or fraud.</li> <li>Regulatory compliance checks in highly regulated industries (e.g., finance, healthcare).</li> <li>Court orders related to lawsuits or judgments.</li> </ul><p>In August 2025, Singaporeâ€™s tax authority (IRAS) charged two men, aged 40 and 73, for their suspected involvement in a <a href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/news-events/newsroom/two-men-charged-for-perpetrating-a--181-million-gst-missing-trader-fraud">$181 million GST Missing Trader Fraud.</a></p><p>They allegedly set up four shell companies and created fictitious sales transactions between them at inflated prices.

Donâ€™t rely on assumptions: Â a freeze due to suspicious activity is very different from one triggered by a creditorâ€™s petition.</p><p>Next, secure your ongoing obligations. If you have automatic debits (e.g., rent, utilities, payroll), arrange alternative payment methods to avoid late fees or disruptions.</p><p>Third, document everything. Keep records of all communications with the bank, creditors, and authorities. This protects you if the situation escalates.</p><p>Finally, act decisively to resolve the root cause. Whether that means paying off a debt, submitting compliance documents, or hiring a lawyer, quick and professional action is key.
