That is why, you should consider specific measures to safeguard user data (e.g., data encryption, access controls).</p></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 340.71px;"> <td style="height: 340.71px;"><p><strong>Easy collaboration</strong></p><p>Real-time data access and editing capabilities make QuickBooks Online ideal for remote teams.Â </p><p>User access controls ensure data security while allowing you to set permission levels for different team members.Â </p><p>You can integrate seamlessly with communication tools of your choice for enhanced collaboration and streamlined workflows.</p><p>Â </p><p>For example, when the tax season comes around, you can invite your trusted tax advisors to check your financial statements, ensure the numbers are correct, and leave commentsÂ </p></td> <td style="height: 340.71px;"><p><strong>Ideal for SMEs</strong></p><p>While QuickBooks Online allows for remote collaboration, it can only be best for small and medium businesses (Up to 25 users maximum for the QuickBooks Online Advanced).Â </p><p>If you work for a big corporation requiring highly specialized functionalities (e.g., project management for contractors), QuickBooks Online may hold your company operations down.</p></td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>QuickBooks Desktop</strong></p><table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100.004%; height: 607.84px;"><colgroup><col style="width: 50.0302%;"><col style="width: 49.9319%;"></colgroup> <thead> <tr style="height: 20.7955px;"> <td style="height: 20.7955px;">Pro</td> <td style="height: 20.7955px;">Cons</td> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr style="height: 246.335px;"> <td style="height: 246.335px;"><p><strong>Customization king</strong></p><p>For businesses seeking a highly tailored accounting experience, QuickBooks Desktop reigns supreme.Â </p><p>Extensive customization options allow you to configure the software to perfectly match your specific business needs.Â </p><p>Industry-specific editions cater to the unique requirements of sectors like manufacturing or construction.Â </p></td> <td style="height: 246.335px;"><p><strong>Collaboration limitations</strong></p><p>Adding new users requires additional software licenses, potentially impacting scalability as your business grows.</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Offline accessibility</strong></p><p>For the majority of businesses, working with the installed desktop software is still the preferred method.Â </p><p>The idea of automatic backup on the cloud may seem ideal, but it is not a much-needed feature since you can still do it with the combo Crtl+S (Which I think is a default action of all computer users).</p><p>Your team can still maintain control over financial records with offline functionality.</p><p>Â </p><p>What if your company still wants to take advantage of cloud storage? You can still do it with QuickBooks Desktop since there are many hosting solutions sorely for QuickBooks Desktop users. (Even QuickBooks offers the cloud service if you want to)</p><p>You can combine the power of cloud hosting while using your QuickBooks Desktop version.</p></td> <td><p><strong>Data accessibility</strong></p><p>Another major drawback is that data is stored locally on the installed computer. So if you want to have team members work on the same file, you have to get it in the common storage space, hindering collaboration in certain workflows.</p></td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p></p><p>Overall, the 2 options are perfect for work flexibility and remote collaborations, you can not go working with either one. My only advice here is that if you are a small team, QuickBooks Online is the go-to solution with its cloud-based accessibility and real-time collaboration feature.</p><p>If you want extra, do not care about price, and have your hosting figured out, QuickBooks Desktop may be your option.</p><h2 class="indexed"><span id="which-version-is-best-for-data-security" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">3.</span> <span class="heading_text">Which version is best for data security?</span></h2><p>Data security is a top priority for any business, and managing your financial information requires a robust security posture.
