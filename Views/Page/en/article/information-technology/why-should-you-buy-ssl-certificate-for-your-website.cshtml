While appealing content and designs to attract customers are important, it is of equal importance that the security of website access and transaction processes has to be considered.Â </p><p>Instilling confidence in your customers during transactions is the key to successful business operations. This is when SSL certificate registration comes into play,</p><p>In this detailed article, we will delve into SSL, its advantages, and the support services available for SSL registration.</p><h2 class="indexed"><span id="what-is-an-ssl-certificate" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">1.</span> <span class="heading_text">What is an SSL certificate?</span></h2><p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), also known as digital certificate, is an encryption technology that keeps data exchange between a web server and a web browser (personal computers, mobiles, tablets ) secure and safe. SSL ensures that third parties cannot exploit and decrypt information exchange.</p><p>Furthermore, SSL serves multiple purposes, including website authentication, securing FTP connections, protecting mail services, enabling VPN functionality, and supporting various other applications.</p><p>When you see a padlock icon next to the URL in the address bar, that means SSL protects the website you are visiting.</p><p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../images/2023/11/ssl-example.png" width="435" height="146" class="float-none" alt="SSL protects users when surfing the web"></p><p>These SSL certificates are exclusively issued by trustworthy Certificate Authorities (CA) worldwide, who meticulously verify registrant information. As a result, users gain a heightened level of trust in the Internet, adding significant value to websites and businesses that offer services.</p><h2 class="indexed"><span id="are-there-many-types-of-ssl-certificates" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">2.</span> <span class="heading_text">Are there many types of SSL certificates?</span></h2><p>There are different types of SSL certificates with different validation levels and purposes. Depending on your needs and budget, you can find the one that truly meets your standards.</p><p>The six main types are:</p><ul> <li>Domain Validated (DV) SSL Certificate: This type of certificate verifies the ownership of the domain only</li> <li>Organization Validated (OV) SSL Certificate: This certificate verifies not only the domain ownership but also the legitimacy of the organization</li> <li>Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificate: EV certificates provide the highest level of validation and trust.</li> <li>Wildcard SSL Certificate: A wildcard SSL certificate covers the main domain and all its subdomains (a.com, help.a.com), making it cost-effective and efficient for websites with multiple subdomains.</li> <li>Multi-Domain (SAN) SSL Certificate or Â UCC (Unified Communications Certificates): This certificate secures multiple domain names within a single certificate (( A.com, B.com, C.com)</li> <li>Code Signing SSL Certificate: This is used to sign and authenticate software or code that has not been tampered with.</li> </ul><h2 class="indexed"><span id="why-you-should-register-an-ssl" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">3.</span> <span class="heading_text">Why you should register an SSL?</span></h2><div data-rlta-element="container" data-rlta-state="initial" data-rlta-id="1" data-rlta-type="accordions" data-rlta-title-tag="div" data-rlta-orientation="vertical" data-rlta-wrap-buttons="false" data-rlta-remember-active="false" data-rlta-theme="neutral" data-rlta-color-panels="false" data-rlta-positioning="top" data-rlta-alignment="left" data-rlta-has-button-scroller="false"><div id="rlta-information-security" role="button" aria-controls="rlta-panel-information-security" aria-expanded="true" tabindex="0" data-rlta-alias="information-security" data-rlta-element="button" data-rlta-state="open"><div data-rlta-element="heading"> Information security</div></div><div id="rlta-panel-information-security" aria-labelledby="rlta-information-security" tabindex="-1" data-rlta-element="panel" data-rlta-state="open" data-rlta-color="false"><div data-rlta-element="panel-content"><p>Google has officially rolled out the Chrome 68 web browser update with the addition of a feature that warns against unsafe sites. When a user visits a website that relies on an HTTP connection, the browser will mark it as "Not Secure." Besides, Google Chrome 68 has asked users to install HTTPS on the website.</p><p>Any hacker who breaks into the connection between your browser and your website can steal all communications sent over an HTTP connection. This is a significant threat if you send or receive sensitive information through the website, like username, password, credit card details, etc.</p><p>With an HTTPS connection, all communications are securely encrypted. This means that even if someone broke into the connection, they couldn't decrypt any data between the browser and the website. HTTPS sites typically use one of two security protocols to encrypt communications - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security).</p><p>When requesting an HTTPS connection to a website, the website first sends an SSL certificate to your browser. This certificate contains the public key needed to initiate a secure session.</p><p>When using a trusted SSL certificate during an HTTPS connection, users will see a padlock icon in the address bar with "Secure" in the browser. When an Extended Validation Certificate (EV SSL) is installed on a website, a padlock icon will appear in the address bar.</p></div></div><div id="rlta-title-a-highly-credible-and-professional-looking-website" role="button" aria-controls="rlta-panel-title-a-highly-credible-and-professional-looking-website" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="0" data-rlta-alias="title-a-highly-credible-and-professional-looking-website" data-rlta-element="button" data-rlta-state="closed"><div data-rlta-element="heading"> title="A highly credible and professional-looking website</div></div><div id="rlta-panel-title-a-highly-credible-and-professional-looking-website" aria-labelledby="rlta-title-a-highly-credible-and-professional-looking-website" tabindex="-1" hidden="true" data-rlta-element="panel" data-rlta-state="closed" data-rlta-color="false"><div data-rlta-element="panel-content"><p>Users increasingly understand and care about network security.
