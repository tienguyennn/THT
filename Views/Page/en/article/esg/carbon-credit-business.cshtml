A company emitting greenhouse gases can buy carbon credits from another company that has reduced its emissions, balancing its environmental impact.</p><p>A real-world example of carbon offsetting is Microsoftâ€™s initiative to become carbon-negative. In 2020, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/01/28/one-year-later-the-path-to-carbon-negative-a-progress-report-on-our-climate-moonshot/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft purchased 1.3 million metric tons of carbon removal</a> from various projects, including forestry, soil sequestration, and carbon capture.</p><h2 class="indexed"><span id="what-is-the-carbon-market" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">2.</span> <span class="heading_text">What is the carbon market?</span></h2><p>The carbon credit market is divided into two primary categories:</p><h3 class="indexed"><span id="mandatory-carbon-market" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">2.1.</span> <span class="heading_text">Mandatory carbon marketÂ </span></h3><p>This market is regulated by international agreements that set common standards for carbon trading.

This protocol has expired but was a major step toward regulating emissions.</p><p>The Paris Agreement, which replaced the Kyoto Protocol, was signed in 2016 by over 195 countries. This agreement is currently in effect and aims for global cooperation to tackle climate change.</p><p>Other regional agreements also play a role. For example, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) operates across Europe, and California has its Cap-and-Trade Program. These programs regulate carbon emissions and encourage businesses to invest in reducing their greenhouse gases.</p><h3 class="indexed"><span id="voluntary-carbon-market" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">2.2.</span> <span class="heading_text">Voluntary carbon market</span></h3><p>This is a more flexible system where organizations, businesses, or even individuals can buy and sell carbon credits to offset their emissions.Â </p><p>Unlike the mandatory market, participation in the voluntary market is not legally required.
