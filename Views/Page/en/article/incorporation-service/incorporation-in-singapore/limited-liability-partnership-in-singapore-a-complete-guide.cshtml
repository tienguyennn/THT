Â The partner can be an individual, a local company, a foreign company or another LLP.Â </p><p>The partners of a Singapore LLP own and run the business.

This means that key features of a Singapore LLP include</p><p><strong>Limited Liability Protection</strong></p><p>The personal assets of partners are generally protected from the LLPâ€™s debts or liabilities.

For tax purposes, an LLP is treated as a partnership rather than a separate taxable entity. This means:</p><ul> <li>Each partner is taxed individually based on their share of the LLPâ€™s profits;</li> <li>If the partner is an individual, their share of income from the LLP is taxed at the individualâ€™s personal income tax rate, from 0% to 24%</li> <li>If the partner is a company, the LLPâ€™s income is taxed at the corporate tax rate of 17%</li> <li>If a partner is a foreign company or individual, they can earn benefits from the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement between Singapore and their home country.</li> </ul><p><strong>Perpetual succession</strong></p><p>The LLP has perpetual succession, which means any change in the partners of an LLP will not affect its existence, rights, or liabilities.</p><h2 class="indexed"><span id="llp-vs-pte-ltd-what-is-the-difference" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">3.</span> <span class="heading_text">LLP vs Pte.Ltd: What is the difference?</span></h2><p>Based on how similar these 2 types of companies are, some entrepreneurs often feel confused not knowing which option is best.Â </p><p>Letâ€™s look at the comparison table below to see the similarities and differences between a limited liability partnership and a private limited company in Singapore.Â </p><p>Our table will help you gain clarity as to why some business owners prefer this legal structure over other.</p><table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100.033%; height: 62.4024px;"><colgroup><col style="width: 16.0652%;"><col style="width: 50.723%;"><col style="width: 33.2496%;"></colgroup> <thead> <tr style="height: 20.8008px;"> <td style="height: 20.8008px;">Aspect</td> <td style="height: 20.8008px;">LLP</td> <td style="height: 20.8008px;">Pte.Ltd</td> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr style="height: 20.8008px;"> <td style="height: 20.8008px;">Similarity</td> <td colspan="2" style="height: 20.8008px;"><ul> <li>Both company types offers separate lega entity from its partners/shareholders.</li> <li>Limited liability for partners/shareholders.</li> <li>Profit is taxed at corporate tax rate for partners as a company the same as a private limited company.</li> <li>Perpetual succession allows for any changes in the partners/shareholders which will not affect the entity existence,</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 20.8008px;"> <td style="height: 20.8008px;">Difference</td> <td style="height: 20.8008px;"><ul> <li>It is a hybrid of partnership and company;</li> <li>It is owned by partners, flexible profit-sharing;</li> <li>It is taxed at personal tax rate for individual partners and a corporate tax rate for corporate partners;</li> <li>It has Lower annual compliance Â and filing;</li> <li>It is hard to raise capital;</li> <li>It has Less credibility for larger contracts;</li> <li>It has no tax on dividend</li> <li>It is suitable for SMEs.</li> </ul> </td> <td style="height: 20.8008px;"><ul> <li>It is a corporate structure with shareholders and directors</li> <li>It is owned by shareholders, share distribution flexibility</li> <li>It is taxed at a corporate tax rate with tax exemption available</li> <li>It has higher annual compliance and filing</li> <li>It is easier to raise capital due to share issuing</li> <li>It has more credibilityÂ </li> <li>It is suitable for growing businesses</li> <li>It has tax on dividendsÂ </li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><h2 class="indexed"><span id="how-to-register-a-limited-liability-partnership-in-singapore" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">4.</span> <span class="heading_text">How to register a Â Limited Liability Partnership in Singapore?</span></h2><p>Setting up an LLP in Singapore is straightforward and can be done online through the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) portal.</p><p>Please note that if you are a foreign entrepreneur or company, you will need a licensed registered agent in Singapore like Global Link Asia Consulting, or an authorized representative in Singapore to help register your LLP.</p><p><strong>Legal Requirements</strong></p><p>To be able to register an LLP, you will need:</p><ol> <li>A company name;</li> <li>A registered address in Singapore;</li> <li>A registered agent or an authorized representative (if you are a foreigner);</li> <li>A local manager who can be a Singapore citizen, permanent resident or an employment pass holder of at least 18 years old.</li> </ol><p><strong>Required documents</strong></p><p>To set up a Singapore Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), you will need to submit the following documents:</p><ul> <li>Completed LLP Application Form (LLP1).</li> <li>Copies of the identification documents (e.g., passports, identity cards) of all partners.</li> <li>Proof of address for all partners (e.g., utility bills, bank statements).</li> <li>A brief business proposal outlining the nature of the business and the expected activities.Â </li> <li><strong>Limited liability partnership agreement: </strong>This is a mandatory requirement.
