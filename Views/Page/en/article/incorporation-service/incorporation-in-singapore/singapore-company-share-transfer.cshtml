You want to pass them to another shareholder, or maybe bring in a completely new investor. On paper, it looks simple. In practice, the law has rules you canâ€™t ignore.</p><p>Under Singapore law, Share Capital, <strong>only fully-paid shares can be transferred</strong>. That means the shareholder must have contributed the full value of their shareholding.</p><p>For example, if you subscribed for 1,000 shares at SGD 1 each, you must have paid the full SGD 1,000 into the company before you can transfer those shares. If youâ€™ve only paid SGD 500, the remaining â€œunpaidâ€ shares are not transferable.</p><p>Every transfer must also respect the companyâ€™s constitution. Thatâ€™s where restrictions, approvals, or preemption rights often come into play.</p><h2 class="indexed"><span id="when-do-you-transfer-shares-of-your-singapore-company" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">2.</span> <span class="heading_text">When do you transfer shares of your Singapore company?</span></h2><p>Share transfers in Singapore donâ€™t just happen at random.
