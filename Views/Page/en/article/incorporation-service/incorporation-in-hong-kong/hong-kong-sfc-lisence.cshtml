A Hong Kong firm providing Type 4 (Advising on Securities) or Type 9 (Asset Management) services only to:</p><ul> <li>It's 100% parent company</li> <li>Its wholly owned subsidiaries</li> <li>Other wholly owned subsidiaries of that parent</li> </ul><p>They qualify to skip a separate license. Because the SFC recognizes that regulated activities within a single corporate family donâ€™t carry the same third-party risks.</p><p>If third-party money is involved, like managing a fund, even intra-group Type 9 activities wonâ€™t be exempt.</p><p>Imagine Harbor Capital Asia, a wholly owned subsidiary of Harbor Group Holdings, a global asset manager. Harbor Capital Asia manages portfolios exclusively for its parent companyâ€™s internal funds and for two other Harbor subsidiaries, with no outside investors.Â  Because all activity stays within the corporate family and no third-party money is involved, they qualify for the intra-group exemption and donâ€™t need a separate Type 9 license.</p><h3 class="indexed"><span id="incidental-exemptions" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">4.2.</span> <span class="heading_text">Incidental exemptions</span></h3><p>Incidental exemptions are another key area.Â Sometimes, one license lets you carry out closely related activities without needing a second one.</p><p>For example:</p><ul> <li>A Type 1 (Dealing in Securities) licensee can also handle Type 4 (Advising on Securities) or Type 9 (Asset Management) if those are incidental to its main business.</li> <li>A Type 9 (Asset Management) licensee can carry out Type 1, Type 2 (Futures), Type 4, and Type 5 (Futures Advising) if these services are part of managing a clientâ€™s assets.</li> <li>Expanded permissions for Type 3 (Leveraged FX Trading) and Type 12 (OTC Clearing) arenâ€™t active yet and await SFC guidance before relying on them.</li> </ul><p>Â Consider Pearl Bay Investments, a Hong Kong asset manager holding a Type 9 license.Â  One of its institutional clients asks Pearl Bay to execute a small number of securities trades directly related to the portfolios Pearl already manages.</p><p>Instead of applying for a separate Type 1 license, Pearl Bay can rely on the incidental exemption: those trades are a necessary part of delivering its core asset management service.Â  By using this exemption properly, Pearl Bay saves time and compliance costs while staying fully within SFC rules.</p><h2 class="indexed"><span id="requirements-for-an-sfc-license" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">5.</span> <span class="heading_text">Requirements for an SFC license</span></h2><p>To help you get the license, our incorporation experts prepare a summary of what you need before applying.
