It limits shareholder liability and is ideal for small to medium businesses.</li> <li><strong>A public company limited by shares</strong> - This is suitable for large companies that want to raise capital from the public or list on the stock exchange.</li> <li><strong>A company limited by guarantee -</strong>Â It is Often used by non-profits or charities. These companies donâ€™t have share capital and instead have members who guarantee a fixed contribution if the company winds up.</li> <li><strong>A private unlimited company with a share capital </strong>- This structure is rarely used. Shareholders have unlimited liability, meaning theyâ€™re personally responsible for the companyâ€™s debts.</li> <li><strong>A public unlimited compan</strong>y with a share capital is similar to the private version, but can offer shares to the public. It is also very uncommon to set up.</li> <li><strong>A branch office</strong> is an extension of a foreign parent company. Â It is not a separate legal entity. This is a choice for major corporations with a well-known brand name</li> <li><strong>A representative office </strong>is used for non-commercial activities like market research or liaison. This is a choice for major corporations</li> <li><strong>A partnership</strong> is formed by two or more people jointly running a business. It is the choice of professionals who want to work together</li> <li><strong>A sole proprietorship</strong> is owned and run by one individual. It is the easiest and cheapest to set up.</li> </ol><p>You donâ€™t need to memorize every type.Â </p><p>In fact,<strong> most foreign entrepreneurs, foreign SMEs go with a private company limited by shares. </strong>Itâ€™s simple, flexible, and widely accepted for business operations.</p><p>But knowing the full list helps you understand the legal landscape and choose the right fit if your situation is more complex.</p><p>If you want to see how each structure works in practice, Â our experts have included real-world examples with the characteristics of each business structure below.</p><h2 class="indexed"><span id="private-limited-company-ltd" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">2.</span> <span class="heading_text">Private limited company (Ltd)</span></h2><p><a href="private-limited-company-hong-kong.html">A private Limited Company</a> is the most popular choice among foreigners starting businesses in Hong Kong.
