Each NFT is distinctly coded and possesses exclusive information, setting it apart from other tokens. Unlike fungible cryptocurrencies like bitcoin which can be traded or exchanged on an equal basis, NFTs are indivisible and irreplaceable, giving them their distinctiveness.</p><p>The innovative aspect of NFTs lies in their uniqueness. Each token has a distinct quality that differentiates it from all others. Moreover, NFTs are expandable, allowing for the creation of a third unique token by merging two existing tokens.</p><p>NFTs serve to digitally authenticate various items, including artwork and in-game assets. They are commonly hosted on blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Flow, which enable this authentication process.</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100.03%; height: 401.458px;" border="1"> <thead> <tr style="height: 20.7917px;"> <td style="width: 25.0372%; height: 20.7917px;">Â </td> <td style="width: 25.0372%; height: 20.7917px;">Â </td> <td style="width: 25.0372%; height: 20.7917px;"><strong>Non-fungible token (NFT)</strong></td> <td style="width: 24.8597%; height: 20.7917px;"><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong></td> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr style="height: 151.958px;"> <td style="width: 25.0372%; height: 151.958px;"><strong>Difference</strong></td> <td style="width: 25.0372%; height: 151.958px;">Nature</td> <td style="width: 25.0372%; height: 151.958px;"><p>â€‹â€‹NFTs are digital representations of tangible or intangible items such as music, art, or collectibles, allowing unique ownership of these assets.</p><p>Â </p></td> <td style="width: 24.8597%; height: 151.958px;">Cryptocurrencies are virtual currencies designed for use as a medium of exchange.
