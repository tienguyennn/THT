In this article, we only focus on 6 popular types with detailed analysis for the majority of domestic and international business owners.</p><p>There are two additional types - B-corp and non-profit companies - which are specialized and used for distinct purposes.

In this setup, the owner is the sole operator of the business. It's managed by one person and is adaptable to various business models, from restaurants to retail stores.</p><p>This type is particularly suitable for low-risk businesses and for entrepreneurs aiming to test their business ideas before registering an official company. It offers simplicity and autonomy for individuals venturing into initial business operations.</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100.03%; height: 41.5834px;" border="1"> <thead> <tr style="height: 20.7917px;"> <td style="width: 49.9857%; height: 20.7917px;">Advantages</td> <td style="width: 49.9857%; height: 20.7917px;">Disadvantages</td> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr style="height: 20.7917px;"> <td style="width: 49.9857%; height: 20.7917px;"><ul> <li>Simple company opening with low incorporation cost</li> <li>No specific amount of capital required</li> <li>Business losses can be deducted from the owner's personal tax payable to the state.</li> <li>The sole responsibility for the company's debts falls entirely on the business owner.</li> <li>You have difficulty raising capital and finding supportive partners due to the structure</li> <li>Â </li> </ul> </td> <td style="width: 49.9857%; height: 20.7917px;"><ul> <li>The sole responsibility for the company's debts falls entirely on the business owner.</li> <li>You have difficulty raising capital and finding supportive partners due to the structure</li> <li>Company profits are calculated as <a href="../../tax-accounting/tax-accounting-in-the-us/us-personal-income-tax.html">personal income,</a> potentially resulting in higher tax payments as personal profits increase.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><h3 class="indexed"><span id="partnership" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">1.2.</span> <span class="heading_text">Partnership</span></h3><p>A partnership involves two or more owners (partners) who collectively share the responsibility for managing the company.</p><p>There are two prevalent types of partnerships: General Partnership (Traditional Partnership) and Limited Partnership.

However, you have a deciding role to oversee and manage the business's operations.</p><ul> <li><strong>Limited partners</strong></li> </ul><p>Act as investors, you contribute capital with liability limited to the extent of your investment. You don't partake in managing the business and are not liable beyond your contributed capital. General partners bear full responsibility for the company's obligations.</p><p>Partnerships are suitable for business owners with specialized professions ( ideally owners in the same industry such as lawyers, doctors, architects), or groups seeking to test a business idea before formal incorporation. Besides, real estate investment companies often opt for this limited partnership structure.</p><p>An important variation is the limited liability partnership (LLP). In an LLP, partners are akin to capital contributors, responsible only for the debts to the extent of their capital input. They're not accountable for the actions and debts of other partners.</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100.03%; height: 41.5834px;" border="1"> <thead> <tr style="height: 20.7917px;"> <td style="width: 49.9857%; height: 20.7917px;">Advantages</td> <td style="width: 49.9857%; height: 20.7917px;">Disadvantages</td> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr style="height: 20.7917px;"> <td style="width: 49.9857%; height: 20.7917px;"><ul> <li>Simple company opening with low incorporation cost</li> <li>Business losses can be deducted from personal tax liabilities (For a company as a partner, it is corporate tax)</li> <li>Responsibilities are clearly outlined among the partners.</li> </ul> </td> <td style="width: 49.9857%; height: 20.7917px;"><ul> <li>This is more expensive to register compared to general partnerships.</li> <li>The structure involves more intricate management and administrative demands compared to traditional partnerships.</li> <li>General partners in an LP bear complete responsibility for business debts and obligations.</li> <li>Profits are taxed as personal income for individuals, potentially resulting in higher taxes as profits increase.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><h3 class="indexed"><span id="c-corporation" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">1.4.</span> <span class="heading_text">C-Corporation</span></h3><p>A traditional joint stock company is often referred to as a C corporation (C corp) to differentiate it from other forms of joint stock companies like S-Corp, B-Corp, Close Corp, and non-profit corporations.</p><p>A C corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners.
