They are dead wrong.</p><p>Selling on Amazon as a foreigner isnâ€™t just about opening an account anymore. Itâ€™s about structuring your business the right way.</p><p>In 2026, Amazon sellers without a U.S. company are running into more barriers than ever.Â </p><ul> <li>Stricter KYC;</li> <li>Bank account verification;</li> <li>Tax and compliance checks that werenâ€™t enforced a few years ago;</li> <li>Heavy investment upfront (from advertising, legal setup, to logistics) to keep your store running in the first year.</li> </ul><p>And this shift is showing up in seller suspensions and slow verification. Our experts at Global Link Asia Consulting reviewed hundreds of Amazon account cases.Â </p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../../../images/2025/12/customer-support.png" width="915" height="349" class="float-none" alt="GLAC clients asking for our expert support at the registration stage" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">This is the email we received from one of the customers we supportedÂ </p><p>Some we supported with success. Others showed risks so high that we had to turn down during the KYC process. Those hard cases had one thing in common: No properly structured U.S. company behind the seller account.</p><p>This isnâ€™t an isolated issue. We had to consult more and more foreign to sell to form Â U.S. companies before launching on Amazon. And the reason goes deeper than compliance.</p><p>In 2026, selling on Amazon as a foreigner requires more than a product and a listing.Â </p><p>In this guide, youâ€™ll learn:</p><ul> <li>Whether you really need a U.S. company to sell on Amazon;</li> <li>How foreigners can legally set up and operate a U.S. compan</li> </ul><p>First, let's begin by understanding why more and more sellers choose to sell on Amazon.</p><h2 class="indexed"><span id="why-are-more-and-more-people-selling-on-amazon" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">1.</span> <span class="heading_text">Why are more and more people selling on Amazon?</span></h2><p>Selling on Amazon means selling directly to consumers through the worldâ€™s most powerful e-commerce marketplace.

More than 60% of Amazonâ€™s total sales now come from independent sellers, most of them small and medium-sized businesses.</p><p>That shift explains why entrepreneurs around the world are moving to Amazon. Amazon offers what most platforms canâ€™t combine in one place:</p><ul> <li>Massive demand;</li> <li>Built-in customer trust;</li> <li>Â World-class logistics (Amazon has launched a new service called Amazon Global Logistics - AGL);</li> <li>Â Scalable growth potential.</li> </ul><p>Instead of building traffic from scratch, sellers plug into an ecosystem with hundreds of millions of ready-to-buy customers.</p><p>And Amazon does the hard parts.</p><ol> <li>Storage;</li> <li>Shipping;</li> <li>Returns;</li> <li>Customer service.</li> </ol><p>Programs like Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) allow even solo founders to operate like large enterprises, without owning warehouses or hiring logistics teams.</p><h3 class="indexed"><span id="omnichannel-opportunity-in-the-u-s" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">1.2.</span> <span class="heading_text">Omnichannel opportunity in the U.SÂ </span></h3><p>Amazon is a powerful marketplace. But the most successful sellers donâ€™t rely on Amazon alone.Â They build systems that sell across multiple platforms, while keeping operations centralized.</p><p>Thatâ€™s where omnichannel selling comes in. Amazon supports this approach with tools designed to extend sales, logistics, and marketing beyond its own marketplace.</p><p>In addition to beingÂ  Amazon sellers, sellers can expand into channels like Walmart Marketplace and TikTok Shop, turning Amazon into the operational backbone, not the only storefront.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="../../../../images/2025/12/seller-looking-to-sell-on-walmart.png" width="100%" height="100%" class="float-none" alt="Sellers are looking for opportunities to sell on Walmart" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" loading="lazy">Sellers are looking for opportunities to sell on Walmart</span></p><h2 class="indexed"><span id="should-you-sell-as-an-individual-or-as-a-business-on-amazon-u-s" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">2.</span> <span class="heading_text">Should you sell as an individual or as a business on Amazon U.S?</span></h2><p>This is the first reason most Amazon sellers fail, or struggle to survive beyond years 2â€“3.Â They choose to sell as an individual on Amazon.
