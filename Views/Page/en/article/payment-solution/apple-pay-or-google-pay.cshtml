It uses tokenization to keep transactions safe.</p><ul> <li>Merchant Google Pay accounts can only be activated with credit or debit cards from certain banks like Citibank or StanChart.</li> <li>Apple Pay works when the business completes setup steps, including connecting to online payment platforms like Braintree, PayPal, or Stripe.</li> </ul><p>Based on your companyâ€™s device Ecosystem</p><p>The choice depends on which operating system your business uses.
