on the total number of shares your company is authorized to issue.</p><p>✅ Assumed Par Value Capital Method – Based on your company's total gross assets and issued shares.</p><p>For LLCs and

class="heading_number">2.2.</span> <span class="heading_text">How to calculate Delaware franchise tax for corporations?</span></h3><p>Delaware corporations have two ways to calculate their franchise tax, and you get to pay the lower amount </p><div class="glac-article-box-cta"><div class="row"><div class="col d-flex flex-column justify-content-center"><p class="glac-article-heading-box-cta">Important tip</p><div class="glac-article-text-box-cta"><p>Delaware offers a downloadable spreadsheet calculator to estimate your franchise tax using both the Authorized Shares and Assumed Par Value Capital methods.</p><p>You can download it <a href="https://corp.delaware.gov/paytaxes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a></p></div></div></div></div><h4>Authorized shares method</h4><p>The authorized shares method calculates the franchise tax based on the total number of shares a corporation is authorized to issue, regardless of how many shares are issued or outstanding. </p><table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.9705%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 49.9557%;"><col style="width: 49.9557%;"></colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td>Number of shares</td> <td>Franchise tax payable</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1 to 5,000 shares </td> <td>$175 (minimum tax)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5,001 to 10,000 shares </td> <td>$250</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Each additional 10,000 shares </td> <td>+$85 per increment</td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p></p><p>For example, a corporation with 6000 shares must pay USD 250. </p><p>The maximum tax under this method is USD 200,000. </p><p>This method can result in a higher tax for corporations with a large number of authorized shares, especially if those shares have a low par value. </p><p>Companies with many authorized but unissued shares must carefully consider this method, as it may lead to significant tax liabilities.</p><p>This method is <strong>often chosen by corporations looking for predictability in their tax obligations, as the tax amount will not fluctuate with changes in the company's financial performance.</strong></p><p>Additionally, if your corporation has shares without par value, you must use the authorized shares method.</p><h4>Assumed par value capital method</h4><p>This method is more complex and depends on your total gross assets and issued shares.</p><p>To use this method, you need to provide figures for all issued and outstanding shares and total gross assets as reported on US Form 1120, Schedule L (Federal Return)</p><p>This method can result in lower tax liabilities for corporations with a high asset base compared to their issued shares. </p><p>It requires a more detailed understanding of the corporation's financial statements, but can be advantageous for companies with significant assets.</p><p>By using this method, corporations can potentially reduce their franchise tax burden if their asset-to-share ratio supports a more favorable calculation.</p><p>To calculate your franchise tax using the assumed par value capital method, you can follow the process below:</p><p>Divide your total gross assets by your total issued shares to get the assumed par value.</p><ol> <li>Multiply your assumed par value by the number of authorized shares with a par value lower than the assumed par;</li> <li>Add the total par value of all shares with a par value higher than the assumed par;</li> <li>Round the sum up to the next million and divide by $1,000,000;</li> <li>Multiply by $400 to get your franchise tax.</li> </ol><p>The minimum tax under this method is $400 and and the maximum tax is $200,000.</p><p>For example, a corporation with 500,000 authorized shares at $1.00 par value and 200,000 authorized shares at $3.00 par value, with gross assets of $800,000 and issued shares totaling 350,000:</p><ol> <li>Calculate the assumed par value: $800,000 ÷ 350,000 = $2.285714;</li> <li>Multiply assumed par by shares with a lower par value: $2.285714 × 500,000 = $1,142,857;</li> <li>Multiply shares with a higher par value by their par value: 200,000 × $3.00 = $600,000;</li> <li>Find the assumed par value of capital: $1,142,857 + $600,000 = $1,742,857;</li> <li>Calculate the tax: You round up $1,742,857 to $2,000,000, and then, 2 × $400 = $800 tax.</li> </ol><div

class="glac-article-text-box-cta"><p>If your company has a high number of authorized shares but low revenue, using the Assumed Par Value Capital Method could save you money</p></div></div></div></div><h4>Large corporate filer</h4><p>If your corporation meets both of these conditions:</p><ul> <li>Listed on a national securities exchange;</li> <li>Reports $ 750 M+ in revenue or assets, with at least $250M in both categories.</li> </ul><p>Your company must pay an annual tax of USD 250,000.</p><h3 class="indexed"><span
