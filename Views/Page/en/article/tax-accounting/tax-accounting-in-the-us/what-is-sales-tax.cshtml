Businesses need to understand the rules that apply in their specific location.</p><p>For example, 45 states and the District of Columbia collect statewide sales taxes.  On one hand, the sales tax rate in Washington is 9.38%, on the other hand, the tax on goods and services in Alabama is 9,29%.</p><h3 class="indexed"><span id="what-is-the-difference-between-sales-tax-and-excise-tax" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">2.2.</span> <span class="heading_text">What is the difference between sales tax and excise tax?</span></h3><p>In some states in the U.S., you will find another tax on goods and services, which is called excise tax,  besides sales tax.</p><p>Excise tax is a specific tax applied to particular goods like gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol, while sales tax applies broadly to most retail transactions.</p><p>Unlike sales tax, excise tax is often included in the price of the product rather than added at checkout.</p><p>For example, Delaware has no state or local sales tax, but it does impose federal excise taxes on certain goods such as alcoholic beverages and cigarettes. This means that while general retail purchases are tax-free, specific products are still subject to additional taxation.</p><h3 class="indexed"><span id="what-is-nexus-in-sales-tax" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">2.3.</span> <span class="heading_text">What is Nexus in sales tax?</span></h3><p>Nexus is the most important concept when understanding US sales tax.

He must calculate the tax and report back to the Texas state authority as Texas imposes a 6.25 percent state sales tax rate.</p><p>Understanding nexus is crucial for businesses selling across state lines or from overseas countries, especially in e-commerce. Failure to comply with nexus laws can lead to audits and penalties.</p><p>That is why, regularly reviewing nexus rules and using automated tax software can help businesses remain compliant.</p><h2 class="indexed"><span id="is-the-sales-tax-different-state-by-state" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">3.</span> <span class="heading_text">Is the sales tax different state-by-state?</span></h2><h3 class="indexed"><span id="overview-of-state-sales-tax-rates" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">3.1.</span> <span class="heading_text">Overview of state sales tax rates</span></h3><p><strong>Each state sets its own sales tax rate, which can range from 0% (as in states like Delaware and Oregon) to over 7%.</strong></p><p>Additionally, many states allow local governments to impose additional sales taxes, which can significantly increase the total tax rate.
