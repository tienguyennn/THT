class="heading_text">What is personal income tax in the US?</span></h2><p>According to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individual-tax-filing">the definition by the US tax authority, the IRS</a>,Â </p><p>Personal Income Tax is <strong>a tax that individuals must pay to the US government based on total income earned during a fiscal year.</strong></p><p>Notably, the US tax system uses the "worldwide" principle.</p><p>US citizens or permanent residents in the US must declare and pay taxes on all worldwide income to the IRS, regardless of which country the income was earned in.</p><p>Declared income may change depending on double tax avoidance agreements between the US and other countries (Double Tax Avoidance Agreement, "DTA").</p><p>Additionally, the US personal income tax system operates on a self-assessment principle.</p><p>Taxpayers are responsible for calculating, declaring, and paying taxes on time themselves.</p><p>The IRS (Internal Revenue Service) is the agency responsible for collecting taxes and checking the accuracy of tax returns.</p><p>For example, a business owner <a href="../../../company-incorporation/the-us.html">registers a company in the US</a> with a salary of $100,000/year and rental income from Europe of $20,000/year.</p><p>Despite living and working in Europe, the business owner must still declare a total income of $120,000 on their US tax return.</p><p>However, they may apply the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion policy to exclude part of foreign work income and the Foreign Tax Credit to avoid double taxation.</p><p>How many types of personal income tax are there in the US?</p><p>The US has <strong>2 main types of personal income tax that businesses need to understand: Federal personal income Tax and State personal income tax.</strong></p><p>Although both are called personal taxes, these 2 types are completely different due to many factors such as governing agencies, state regulations, and tax calculation methods.</p><table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 209.579px;"><colgroup><col style="width: 33.2948%;"><col style="width: 33.2948%;"><col style="width:
