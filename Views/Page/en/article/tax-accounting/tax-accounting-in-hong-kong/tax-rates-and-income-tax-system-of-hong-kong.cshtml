This mechanism is based on the legislative package developed by the Kingdom of England for its colonies. Thus, the IRO Inland Revenue Ordinance bears great resemblance to the tax systems of the UK, Australia, South Africa, and other Commonwealth countries. When the tax system was first introduced in 1940, it was intended to be an interim measure - and to be replaced within a year or so, by a higher tax rate.</p><p>There was no tax reform in the period from 1945 to 1970, although two review committees were founded in 1954 and 1967. During the 1970s, Hong Kong developed rapidly and became a modernized city and eventually a country that stood out as an important financial and international trade center. That tremendous growth led to the need for structural reforms in the tax system to increase public expenditure and tax rates. Therefore, the Third Review Committee was established. However, the colonial government did not agree to the proposals. As a result, the tax system, although established in the 1940s, has stayed mainly unchanged.</p><p>In 1997, the Government issued advisory guidance on the profit tax system, calling forth proposals on how to improve Hong Kong's tax competitiveness and business environment. As a result of this initiative, several proposals were introduced in 1998. A follow-up review committee was established in 2002, which proposed the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST). The government seriously considered introducing GST but rejected the proposal in December 2006 due to widespread public outcry.</p><h2 class="indexed"><span id="how-can-we-help-you-incorporate-and-manage-your-hong-kong-company-successfully" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">3.</span> <span class="heading_text">How can we help you incorporate and manage your Hong Kong company successfully?</span></h2><ul> <li><a href="../../../company-incorporation/hong-kong.html">Register a company in Hong Kong;</a></li> <li><a href="../../../open-a-bank-account/bank-account-opening-in-hong-kong.html">Open a corporate bank account in Hong Kong</a> with a 99% success rate;</li> <li>Choose the right company types for tax optimization in Singapore;</li> <li>Consular legalize all your Hong Kong important documents</li> <li>Apply for Singapore business licenses;</li> <li>Get an affordable, professional <a href="../../../a-to-z-service/business-address.html">registered office address for business</a>;</li> <li>Support to open, authenticate, and manage S<a href="../../../a-to-z-service/payment-solutions.html">tripe Paypal Business in Singapore, Hong Kong, and the U.S</a>;</li> <li><a href="../../../tax-accounting/tax-accounting-in-hong-kong.html">Handle all your Hong Kong tax accounting needs, timely annual filings, auditing, and more</a>.</li> </ul><h2 class="indexed"><span id="faqs-about-the-hong-kong-tax-system" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">4.</span> <span class="heading_text">FAQs about the Hong Kong tax system</span></h2><div class="ja-typo-legend legend-rounded legend-2"><div data-rlta-element="container" data-rlta-state="initial" data-rlta-id="2" data-rlta-type="accordions" data-rlta-title-tag="div" data-rlta-orientation="vertical" data-rlta-wrap-buttons="false" data-rlta-remember-active="false" data-rlta-theme="neutral" data-rlta-color-panels="false" data-rlta-positioning="top" data-rlta-alignment="left" data-rlta-has-button-scroller="false"><div id="rlta-1-which-companies-would-qualify-for-the-two-tiered-profits-tax-rates" role="button" aria-controls="rlta-panel-1-which-companies-would-qualify-for-the-two-tiered-profits-tax-rates" aria-expanded="true" tabindex="0" class="icon-faq" data-rlta-alias="1-which-companies-would-qualify-for-the-two-tiered-profits-tax-rates" data-rlta-element="button" data-rlta-state="open"><div data-rlta-element="heading"> 1.
