It requires <strong>intention and deliberate action </strong>to hide true financial information from tax authorities.</p><p>There are various business examples you can think of when it comes to tax evasion, for example:</p><ol> <li>A company director transferring money to personal accounts but recording them as business expenses</li> <li>A business deliberately maintains two sets of financial recordsâ€”one showing actual income and another showing reduced income for tax purposes</li> <li>A business claiming expenses for purchases that never occurred</li> <li>A restaurant owner pocketing cash payments without recording them as sales</li> </ol><h2 class="indexed"><span id="tax-evasion-vs-tax-avoidance-what-is-the-difference" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">2.</span> <span class="heading_text">Tax evasion vs Tax avoidance: What is the difference?</span></h2><p>First things first:</p><p><strong>Tax evasion is illegal.</strong> It involves deliberately hiding income or providing false information to reduce tax liability.</p><p>Tax avoidance is legal.
