Wanting to plan ahead for retirement while optimizing his taxes, he decides to contribute to his SRS account. In 2024, he deposits $13,500 into his SRS account.</p><p>Hereâ€™s how his tax situation changes:</p><ul> <li>Annual income: $85,000</li> <li>SRS contribution for the year: $13,500</li> <li>Taxable income after SRS Contribution: $71,500 ($85,000 - $13,500)</li> </ul><p>By making this contribution, Mr. Lim effectively lowers his taxable income, which helps reduce his tax liability. Not only does this result in immediate tax savings, but it also allows him to set aside funds for retirement.</p><p>However, keep in mind that SRS tax relief is not granted if the SRS account is suspended by 31 December of the contribution year or if the contribution is withdrawn within the same year.</p><h3 class="indexed"><span id="how-to-qualify-for-srs-relief" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_number">2.12.</span> <span class="heading_text">How to qualify for SRS relief?</span></h3><p>Singapore Citizens, Singapore Permanent Residents (SPRs), and foreigners can open an SRS account if they meet the following conditions:</p><ul> <li>At least 18 years old.</li> <li>Not an undischarged bankrupt.</li> <li>Not suffering from a mental disorder and able to manage their affairs.</li> <li>Have not previously opened an SRS account (including accounts that were suspended).</li> <li>Have no pending application with another SRS operator.</li> <li>Did not have an SRS account in the past, where all the funds were withdrawn due to: <ul> <li>Medical grounds, or</li> <li>Reaching the statutory retirement age at the time of the first contribution.</li> </ul> </li> </ul><p>This ensures that individuals who can manage their finances can take full advantage of the SRS for retirement planning.</p></div></div><div id="rlta-7-tax-relief-for-married-couples-and-families" role="button" aria-controls="rlta-panel-7-tax-relief-for-married-couples-and-families" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="0" data-rlta-alias="7-tax-relief-for-married-couples-and-families" data-rlta-element="button" data-rlta-state="closed"><div data-rlta-element="heading"> 7.
